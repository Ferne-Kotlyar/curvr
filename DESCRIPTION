Description: Calculate point-wise curvature from 
    landmarked specimens that have been fitted by polynomials in Momocs.
     Polynomials are parameterized by arc length to ensure even sampling
    intervals across the curve. Point-wise curvature is summed 
    across the polynomial, outputting 'total curvature'.
